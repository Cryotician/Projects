# Web App Login Brute-Force
    What is a Brute-Force Attack?

    A brute force attack uses trial and error to guess login info, encryption keys or find a hidden web page. Hackers work through all possible combinations hoping to guess correctly.

    These attacks are done by brute force meaning they use excessive forceful attempts to try and force their way into your private accounts.

    This is an old attack method, but its still effective and popular with attackers(hackers). Depending on the length and complexity of the password, cracking it can take anywhere from a few seconds to many years.
